A python based C\+A\+M scripting system

This is a system for designing 2\+D objects in python and outputting G\+Code, svg etc

to produce output the input files are created as python scripts which are executed within \hyperlink{camcam_8py}{camcam.\+py} This is slightly odd but means they can behave more like save files, than source files.

Run like\+:

python \hyperlink{camcam_8py}{camcam.\+py} -\/m \mbox{[}mode\mbox{]} file1.\+py file2.\+py mode\+: diagram -\/ produces one file with all the parts drawn on visualise -\/ produces an svg with all parts, and the cutting line around the outside dave-\/emc -\/ emc2 compatible gcode makespacerouter -\/ very simple gcode formatted as D\+O\+S file eagle -\/ a file you can import into eagle P\+C\+B software laser -\/ individual svg files for each part

python \hyperlink{camcam_8py}{camcam.\+py} -\/\+B will produce a bill of materials

It has quite nice features for dealing with objects made of multiple layers It can do funky things with finger joints including create arbitary polyhedra from them with the Arbitrary\+Box

as the docs indicate this is very alpha atm
